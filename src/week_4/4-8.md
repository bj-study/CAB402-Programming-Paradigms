# 4.8: Learn about Avoiding Imperative Control Flow in F#

## Imperative Control Flow
It's possible to write imperative control flows in F# however, it is not recommended.

```fsharp
while expr do
    body

for i = expr to expr do
    body

for i in expr
    body
```

One place you could use imperative control flows however, would be when defining a sequence.

## How to avoid using loops
Here are a few examples as to how we can avoid using looping.

```fsharp
// Imperative - ❌
for i = 1 to 10
    printf "%i" i

// Functional - ✅
[1..10]
|> List.iter (printf "%i")

---

// Imperative - ❌
let mutable i = 0

while i*i < 100 do
    printfn "%i" i
    i <- i + 2

// Functional - ✅
Seq.initInfinite ((*) 2)
|> Seq.takeWhile (fun i -> i*i < 100)
|> Seq.iter (printfn "%i")
```

**Programming Exercise**: The following F# code computes the total length of a 
path that travels through all cities and then back to the start. Rewrite the 
`tourLength` function in a pure functional style by using the `Array.map2` function 
rather than using a for loop and mutable state.

Note: The code-block below can be edited.

```fsharp,editable
type City = { x: float; y: float }

let distance (cityA: City) (cityB: City) : float =
    let sqr x = x * x
    sqrt (sqr (cityA.x - cityB.x) + sqr (cityA.y - cityB.y))
    
let tourLength (cities: City array) : float =
    let mutable sum = 0.0

    for i = 0 to cities.Length-2 do
        sum <- sum + distance cities.[i] cities.[i+1]

    sum <- sum + distance cities[cities.Length-1] cities.[0]

    sum
```
