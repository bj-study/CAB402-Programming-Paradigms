# 4.7: Learn about F# functions with Side-Effects

## Unit type
Every expression in F# must evaluate to a value. For expressions that don't generate
some value, a value of type `unit` (`()`) is returned.

The `unit` type can be thought of as a void type in languages such C# or C++.

For example, when we print things to the stdout using `printf` or `printfn`
the return type of those functions are of type `unit`.

## Sequential Composition Operator
The sequential composition operator is a way of chaining expressions[^note].

For example, say we have the expression:

```fsharp
printfn "Hello"
printfn "World"
let foo = 42
```

We could also write this out using sequential composition:

```fsharp
let foo =
    printfn "Hello";
    printfn "World";
    42
```
