# 4.6: Learn about F# Arrays

## Arrays
Arrays are very similar to Lists however, they do have some differences:
- Lists are immutable while arrays are mutable
- Arrays support efficient random access to elements
- Unlike Lists, Arrays do not support pattern matching `head::tail`

```fsharp
let a = [| 2; 5; 3; 2; 9 |]
let element = a.[2]

a.[1] <- 4
```

## Map
A map, also know as a dictionary of hastable, is a fixed-element key-value store datatype.

```fsharp
// Recursively create a map from a list and apply `f` to each value
let rec hashlist f L =
    match L with
    | [] -> Map.empty
    | head::tail -> Map.add head (f head) (hashlist tail)

// Index a map by it's key
let result = m.[x]
```
