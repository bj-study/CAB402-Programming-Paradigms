# 4.4: Learn about Object-Oriented Programming in F#

## Classes

```fsharp
type Coordinate(x, y) =
    member this.X = x
    member this.Y = y
    member this.Length = (x*x + y*y) |> float |> sqrt
    override this.ToString() = "(" + x.ToString() + "," + y.ToString() + ")"
    member.this.Add (other:Coordinate) = new Coordinate(x + other.X, y + other.Y)

let g = new Coordinate(4.4, 5.5)
// val g: Coordinate = (4.4 , 5.5)

let h = g.Add(Coordinate(1.3, 1.2))
// val h: Coordinate = (5.7 , 6.7)

let l = g.Length
// val l: float =  7.04343661
```

## .NET Interop
A principle of the .NET platform is that any program written within one of the .NET 
languages should be able to interoperate with software components written in other
.NET languages.

This means that F# programs can use a wide range of types and functions implemented
in other .NET languages like C# and Visual Basic.

Using .NET classes within F# is as simple as either using it's fully qualified type
name:

```fsharp
System.Web.HttpRequest
```

or via an `open` statement (equivalent to `using` in C# or `import` in Java):

```fsharp
open System.Web
```
