# CAB402 Study Guide | 2023 Semester 1

Dr Wayne Kelly | Notes for CAB402 at the Queensland University of Technology

## Unit Description

This advanced unit exposes you to special-purpose programming languages that operate under different paradigms than the conventional "imperative" languages you have used in the course so far. This unit will expose you to new ways of thinking about and expressing software solutions, exploring advanced programming language constructs, principles for the sound design of new languages and how they evolve. The unit provides both a deep theoretical foundation for programming languages by abstracting them to basic mathematical forms as well as showcasing practical application of those advanced principles for software development in the real world.

## Disclaimer

Everything written here is based off the QUT course content. However, there are at times parts of text that are taken from the QUT slides and most of the examples are directly from the course slides (these are referenced when done). This content is designed only for those currently studying an IT degree at QUT, do not share these resources with anyone outside of this community.

If any member of the QUT staff or a representative of such finds any issue with these guides please contact me at jeynesbrook@gmail.com and I will take these down without an argument. The last thing I want to do is cause any issues or damages to the QUT name or QUT resources. I am simply just trying to help students out with presenting the content in an easy to digest manor.
