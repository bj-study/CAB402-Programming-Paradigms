# Learn about the F# Async Monad

## Use of Monads
There are many uses for monads due to their versatility. You can find monads used
to represent:
- Collections such as lists and sets
- External state
- Continuations
- Asynchronous computations
- LINQ like expressions
- and more..

## `Async` Monad
The `Async` monad in F# let's us include asynchronous code.

```fsharp
open Microsoft.FSharp.Control.CommonExtensions

let fetchUrlAsync url =
    async {
        let req = WebRequest.Create(Uri(url))
        use! resp = req.AsyncGetResponse()
        use stream = resp.GetResponseStream()
        use reader = new IO.StreamReader(stream)
        let html = reader.ReadToEnd()

        printfn "Finished downloading %s" url
    }

let sites = [
    "https://www.google.com";
    "https://www.bing.com"
]

sites
|> List.map fetchUrlAsync
|> Async.Parallel
|> Async.RunSynchronously
```
