# Learn about Monads

## What are Monads?
I'm going to try my best to put [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2w45qRc3aU) 
into words here but I highly recommend watching it as it will do a much better 
job at explaining Monads then I can. All code and examples I show below are 
taken and, in some cases, edited from the video.

What does this actually mean? Let's put this into context with an example.

Imagine we have two basic functions, `square()` and `addOne()` which both take in
some integer and return some integer.

```ts
const square = (x: number): number => {
    return x * x;
}

const addOne = (x: number): number => {
    return x + 1;
}
```

We could use them in conjunction like so `addOne(square(2)) => 5`. Let's now imagine
we want to be able to keep some kind of operation log, i.e. how did 2 end up as 5.

To do this we'll start by creating a new data type to handle this:

```ts
interface LoggedNumber {
    result: number
    logs: string[]
}
```

The functions we defined above would be refactored as so:

```ts
const square = (x: number): LoggedNumber => {
    const result = x * x;
    const logs = [ `Squared ${x} to get ${result}.` ];

    return {
        result,
        logs
    };
}

const addOne = (x: number): LoggedNumber => {
    const result = x + 1;
    const logs = [ `Added 1 to ${x} to get ${result}.` ];

    return {
        result,
        logs
    };
}
```

While this looks great we're going to run into some issues. Due to `square()` and 
`addOne()` both taking in a `number` but returning a `LoggedNumber`, they can
no longer be used in conjunction.

```ts
addOne(square(2));
// Argument of type 'LoggedNumber' is not assignable to parameter
// of type `number`
```

To fix this, let's introduce a new helper function `wrapNumWithLogs()` to help
convert a `number` to a `LoggedNumber`. In addition, we'll refactor our previous
functions to now take in a `LoggedNumber`.

```ts
const wrapNumWithLogs = (x: number): LoggedNumber => {
    return {
        result: x,
        logs: []
    }
}

const square = (x: LoggedNumber): LoggedNumber => {
    const result = x.result * x.result;
    const logs = [ `Squared ${x.result} to get ${result}.` ];

    return {
        result,
        logs: x.logs.concat(logs)
    };
}

const addOne = (x: LoggedNumber): LoggedNumber => {
    const result = x.result + 1;
    const logs = [ `Added 1 to ${x.result} to get ${result}.` ];

    return {
        result,
        logs: x.logs.concat(logs)
    };
}
```

We can now replicate the original logic we had:

```ts
addOne(square(wrapNumWithLogs(2))) => {
    "result": 5,
    "logs": [
        "Squared 2 to get 4.",
        "Added 1 to 4 to get 5."
    ]
} 
```

Looking at the code within our `square()` and `addOne()` functions, we can see
that we have a bit of duplication in regards to our log concatenation. Let's define
a new function `runWithLogs()` to help us abstract this process.

This function will take in some `LoggedNumber` as well as a function which takes in
some `number` and returns a `LoggedNumber`. Doing so will allow us to further refactor
the `addOne()` and `square()` functions by removing the concatenation logic as well
as the need to take in a `LoggedNumber`.

```ts
const runWithLogs = (
    input: LoggedNumber, 
    transform: (_: number) => LoggedNumber
): LoggedNumber => {
    // Here, we call the function passed in, `transform`, on our input `LoggedNumber`
    const newLoggedNumber = transform(input.result);

    return {
        result: newLoggedNumber.result,
        logs: input.logs.concat(newLoggedNumber.logs)
    };
}

const square = (x: number): LoggedNumber => {
    return {
        result: x.result * x.result,
        logs: [ `Squared ${x.result} to get ${result}.` ]
    };
}

const addOne = (x: number): LoggedNumber => {
    return {
        result: x.result + 1,
        logs: [ `Added 1 to ${x.result} to get ${result}.` ]
    };
}
```

Looking back at our original goal, we can now run our functions in conjunction
without the need to think about the data transformations. 

```ts
const a = wrapNumWithLogs(5)
const b = runWithLogs(a, addOne)
const c = runWithLogs(b, square)
```

Not only this we've
- Made it easier to extend this with further functions, e.g. `multiplyByThree`
- Hidden away the concatenation logic from our `square()` and `addOne()` functions

So now what? How does this all related to what Monads are? Well.. what we just wrote
was a Monad!

Let's take a look back at the definition we defined earlier:

> "Monads are a design pattern that allows a user to chain operations while the monad
> manages secret work behind the scenes"

All monads have 3 components:
1. **A wrapper type**: In the example above, this was the `LoggedNumber` type
2. **A wrap function** that allows entry into the monad ecosystem. This also known
    as _return_, _pure_, or _unit_: In the example above, this was the `wrapNumWithLogs()` function
3. **A run function** that runs transformations on monadic values. This is also known
    as _bind_, _flatMap_, or _>>=_: In the example above, this was the `runWithLogs()` function
