# Learn about Monoids

## Monoids
Imagine we have three functions:

```
f :: a -> a
g :: a -> a
h :: a -> a
```

Since all these functions take in a value of type `a` and return a value of type
`a`, we can create new functions by composing them together:

\\[
    ( f \circ g) \text{  } x = g \text{ } (f \text{ } x)
\\]

As well as this, it can be seen that there exists an identity function \\(I\\)
such that:

\\[
    I \circ f = f \circ I = f
\\]

A monoid is the set of functions \\(S\\), of type `a -> a`, together with the
composition operator (\\(\circ\\))
