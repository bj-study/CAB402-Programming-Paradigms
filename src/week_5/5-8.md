# Learn about the Sequence Monad

## Seq Monad
The whole time we've been created sequences in F#, we've actually been using a monad,
the `seq` monad.

```fsharp
seq { 
    yield x;
    yield! Range (lower + 1)
}
```

`yield` and `yield!` are two optional standard methods that builder classes can
implement.

## Sequence as a Monad
If we recall back to the definition of the bind monad being:

```fsharp
Bind : M<t> ->  (t -> M<u>) -> M<u>
```

we can actually break down the process into four steps:
1. The monad-related structure of the first argument is opened to expose
the underlying type `t`
2. The given function is then appliend to these values to obtain the new values of type `(M u)`
3. The monad-related structure on those values are then opened exposing type `u`
4. The monad-related structure is then reassembled over all the results returning a single value of `(M u)`

Using this knowledge, let's break down what happens with the `seq` monad.

```fsharp
seq.Bind : Seq<t> -> (t -> Seq<u>) -> Seq<u>
S ; f
```

1. First, `S` produces values of type `t`
2. For each `x` from `S`, function `f` is applied to create a new value of type `Seq<u>`
3. For each sequence created, it produces values of type `u`
4. All the values of type `u` are used to construct a new sequence of type `u`

## List Comprehension

We can create lists based of some condition via list comprehension:

```fsharp
let isOkay x = ...

seq { for x in 1..n do 
        if isOkay x then 
            yield 2 * x }

seq { for x in [2, 5, 10] do
        for y in [8, 10, 11] do
            if x * y > 50 then
                yield x * y }
```
