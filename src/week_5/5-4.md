## Implementing Monads
To implement a monad in F#, we first need to create a builder class containing
definitions for a `Bind()` and `Return()` method. For example, if we were to
re-create the `Maybe` monad, we might write something like:

```fsharp
type MaybeBuilder() =
    member this.Bind(x, f) =
        match x with
        | Some(v) -> f v
        | _ -> None

    member this.Return(v) = Some v

let maybe = new MaybeBuilder()

let foo (oa: Option<int>) (ob: Option<int>) (oc: Option<int>) =
    maybe {
        let! (a: int) = oa
        let! (b: int) = ob
        let! (c: int) = oc

        return (a + b / c)
    }
```
