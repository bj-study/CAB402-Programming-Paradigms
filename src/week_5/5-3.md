# Learn about Monad Theory

## Monadic Types
A monadic type can be thought of as a container for other values. For example, 
`Option<T>` is a monadic type that can contain `Some<T>` or None.

```
type Option<'t> = Some of 't | None
```

So what happens when we alter the functions within \\(S\\) so that they all produce
a result of type `M<a>`:

```f: a -> M<a>``` 

This would result in the functions `f` and `g` to no longer be directly composed 
with each other. A monad, is an adapter function which allows these two functions
to work with each other.

As previously mentioned, a monad needs a
> **A wrap function** that allows entry into the monad ecosystem, also known 
as _return_, _pure_, or _unit_ and **a run function** that runs transformations 
on monadic values, also known as _bind_, _flatMap_, or _>>=_. 

We can define the bind function as such:

```
M<b> -> (b -> M<c>) -> M<c>
```

and the return function as:

```
a -> M<a>
```
