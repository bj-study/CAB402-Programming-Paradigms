# Learn about the Haskell IO Monad

## IO
Haskell, another popular functional programming language, has a monadic type called
IO. It's used to represent actions that can change the current state of something.

For example, File operations which depend on the state change of the file system
use monadic types in their signatures:

```haskell
doesFileExist :: FilePath -> IO<bool>
removeFile :: FilePath -> IO<void>
putStrLn :: String -> IO<void>
getLine :: IO<String>
```

Haskell allows these functions to be sequenced via the `do` operator:

```haskell
main :: IO<void>
main = do
    putStrLn "What is your name?"
    name <- getLine
    putStrLn ("Hello, " ++ name ++ "!")
```
