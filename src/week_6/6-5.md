# Learn about Anatomy of a LINQ Statement

## LINQ Projection (select)

```csharp
var query = from cust in Customer
            select new { Name = cust.Name, City = cust.City };
```

## LINQ Filtering (where)

```csharp
var query = from cust in Customer
            where cust.City == "London"
            select cust;

var query2 = from cust in Customer
             where cust.City == "London" && cust.Name == "Devon"
             select cust;
```

## LINQ Ordering (orderby)

```csharp
var query = from cust in Customer
            where cust.City == "London"
            orderby cust.Name ascending
            select cust;
```

## LINQ Grouping (group)

```csharp
var query = from cust in Customer
            group cust by cust.City;

var query2 = from cust in Customer
             group cust by cust.City into custGroup
             where custGroup.Count() > 2
             orderby custGroup.Key
             select custGroup;
```

## LINQ Join (join)

```csharp
var query = from cust in customers
            join dist in distributors on cust.City equals dist.City
            select new { Name = cust.Name, Distributor = dist.Name };
```
