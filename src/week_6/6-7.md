# Learn about LINQ Method Syntax

## LINQ Method Syntax
As we saw in the previous pages, LINQ syntax is very similar to SQL syntax.
We can however, write LINQ syntax using method chaining like we would in functional
programming. 

```csharp
IEnemurable<int> querySyntax = from num in numbers
                               where num % 2 == 0
                               orderby num
                               select num;
```

```csharp
IEnemurable<int> methodSyntax = numbers.Where(num => num % 2 == 0).OrderBy(n => n);
```
