# Learn about Object Relational Mapping

## Object Relational Mapping Frameworks
Object relational mapping frameworks convert data between incompatible type systems
in OOP languages to relation mappings.

## Object Relational Impedance Mismatch
Object relational impedance mismatch is a set of conceptual and technical challenges
faced when a relational database management system needs to be used by a progam
written in an OOP style.

The challenge comes from figuring out how to represent and convert data types between
the two stores. In OOP, relationships between objects are represented using pointers
while in relational models, relationships are represented within relations or as
foreign keys. This means there isn't always a one-to-one mapping between objects and rows.
