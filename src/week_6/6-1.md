# Learn about Relational Model

## Relation Model
A relation is a homogeneous set of records with each record consisting of a
heterogeneous set of uniquely named attributes. These relations provide the sole
means for structuring data in a relational model.

There are two types of relations:
1. **Base relations**: Those of which that are stored directly
2. **Derived relations**

For example:

| Name | FName | City | Age | Salary |
|------|-------|------|-----|--------|
| Smith | John | 3 | 35 | $280 |
| Doe | Jane | 1 | 28 | $325 |
| Brown | Scott | 3 | 41 | $265 |
| Howard | Tom | 4 | 48 | $359 |

## Relational Algebra
There are many operations that can be performed on relational models:
- Restrict
- Project
- Product
- Union
- Intersection
- Difference
- Join
- Divide

We can use SQL to put these operations into practice:

```SQL
SELECT WORKDEPT MAX(SALARY)
FROM DSN8A10.EMP Q
GROUP BY WORKDEPT
HAVING MAX(SALARY) < (SELECT AVG(SALARY)
                      FROM DNS8A10.EMP
                      WHERE NOT WORKDEPT = Q.WORKDEPT);
```
