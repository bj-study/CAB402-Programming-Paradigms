# Static vs Dynamic Languages

## Dynamic languages
Dynamic languages are languages which allow you to do at runtime, what static
languages can only allow you to do at compile time, i.e. add new code, change code,
perform checks at runtime.

## Why Static Typing?
- Catches bugs (early) that are otherwise hard to find
- Aids readability and maintainability by documenting types
- Allows programming environments to be much more helpful
