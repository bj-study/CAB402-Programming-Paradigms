# How to use Dynamic Languages

## Dynamic Typing and Testing
Using a dynamically typed language requires the systematic use of test cases
to take the place of the static type checker.

- Static typing: An object can be passed to a method if it belongs to a class
that is declared to implement a specific interface.
- Duck typing: An object can be passed to a method if it supports all of the
methods that method actually makes use of.
