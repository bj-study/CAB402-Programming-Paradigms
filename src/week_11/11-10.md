# Progamming Language Design Principles

## Language Design Principles
1. **Efficiency**
2. **Regularity**
    - Generality: Small number of general concepts without exceptions
    - Orthogonality: Each concept can be understood in isolation and combined arbitrarily
    - Uniformity: Similar things look the same
3. **Simplicity**: Make things as simple as possible, but not simpler
4. **Expressiveness**: Make it possible to express ideas directly and simply
5. **Extensibility**: Allow the programmer to extend the language
6. **Preciseness**: Existence of a precise definition for the language
7. **Restrictability**: Possible for the programmer to usefully know and use only a 
subset of the language
