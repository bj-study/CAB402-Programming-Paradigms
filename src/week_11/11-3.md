# Why Compiled, Interpreted, and JIT Compiled

Why Compiled?
- Automatically detect some errors at compile time
- Can spend considerable time working out how to generate optimised machine code

Why Interpreted?
- Avoids the edit, compile, execute development loop

Why Managed Execution (Virtual machines and JITs)
- Due to it just in time generating machine code, it can execute almost as fast
as compiled code
- In some cases, JITs can produce better code because they have access to information
available only at runtime and can adjust the code as it executes
- Can act as a manager at runtime to coordinate loading of componenets, version 
management, security checking, etc.
