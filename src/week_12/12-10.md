# 32 vs 64 bit Hardware

## 32bit vs 64bit
The bits refers to the size of the registers. Having bigger registers means
arithmetic operations can wokr on larger numbers and your logical operations
can work on more bits in parallel. Bigger registers also allow you to point
to a larger range of memory addresses and therefor use larger physical memory.

32bit x86 code will execute on an x86-64 processor. 64bit x86 code will not 
execute on an 32 processor.

## Compiling Example

- High level code
    ```
    int i = (x + y) * (x + y) - z;
    ```

- x86 un-optimized
    ```
    mov    eax, dword ptr [x]
    add    eax, dword ptr [y]
    mov    ecx, dword ptr [x]
    add    ecx, dword ptr [y]
    imul   eax, ecx
    sub    eax, dword ptr [z]
    mov    dword ptr [i], eax
    ```

- x86 optimized
    ```
    add    esi, eax  ; esi = esi + eax
    imul   esi, esi  ; esi = esi * esi
    sub    esi, eax  ; esi = esi - eax
    ```
