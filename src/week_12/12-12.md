# Allocating Registers

## Register Allocation
Only a small finite number of registers are available, this means register allocation
is an important task. The compiler needs to decide which registers will store each
value.

The goal is to minimise unnecessary loading and storing to memory as these operations
are costly. If the lifetime of two values don't overlap then they can both be stored in the
same register. Graph colouring is an algorithm used to find an optimal solution
to this problem.

The graph colouring algorith is an NP-Complete problem. Compilers use tricks to
instead of calculating the best colouring, calculate a good enough colouring for
the task at hand.
