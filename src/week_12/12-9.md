# The Code Generation Phase

## Immediate Code
Many compilers first translate to an intermediate code and then from intermediate
code to machine code. Intermediate code is geneally low level but machine independent.

Intermediate code is generally language independent. Different "front-end" compilers
can share the same code generation infrastructure.

## Common Instruction Sets
- x86 (most PCs and servers)
- ARM (Mobile phones, tablets and embedded, low power)

## Instruction Sets
- RISC: Reduced Instruction Set computer (ARM)
- CISC: Complex Instruction Set computer (Intel)
- VLIW: Very Long Instruction Word (instruction parallel RISC)

## Instructions
- Arithmetic/Logic
    - add, subtract, multiply, divide
    - and, or, shift, compare
    - Typically inputs and outputs are registers
- Memory Load/Store
    - Load contents of a memory location into a register
    - Store contents of a register into a memory location
    - Memory address typically comes from a register
    - Various address modes
- Control Flow
    - Conditional and unconditional jump and function call/return
    - Conditional typically based on a register
    - Jump to a new memory address
    - Changes the Program Counter (PC) register
