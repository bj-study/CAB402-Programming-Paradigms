# The Semantic Analysis Phase

## Semantic Analysis
The semantic analysis does:
1. Name resolution
2. Type checking
3. Data flow analysis

## Name Resolution
For each name (identifier), the semantic analyser will:
1. Map each identifier to it's corresponding declaration (local variable, parameter, class or type, package declaration)
2. Nested lexical scopes
3. Declaration may come after use

For compound names, for example `Console.WriteLine`, the semantic analyser will:
1. Resolve `Console` within the current scope
2. Then resolve `WriteLine` within the located scope

## Type Checking
The semantic analyser will type check by performing a bottum up traversal of the 
AST. Types of children are checked/evaluated prior to parents.
