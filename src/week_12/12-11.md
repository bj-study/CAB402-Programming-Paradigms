# Addressing Modes

## Addressing Modes
An addressign mode describes what kind of operands an instruction can take.
Different processors support different addressing modes.

Common Addressing modes:
- Immediate: operand = a specific address
- Register: operand = register[r]
- Indiect: operand = memory[register[base] + register[offset] * constant_size + constant_offset]

- x64 examples
    - `ADD EAX, 14  ; add 14 into 32-bit EAX`
    - `ADD R8L, AL  ; add 8bit AL into R8L`
    - `MOV R8W, 1234[8 * RAX + RCX]  ; move word at address 8 * RAX + RCX + 1234 into R8W`
