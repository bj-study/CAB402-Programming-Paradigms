# Selecting Machine Code Instructions

## Instruction Selection
For each high level operation, the compiler must decide which machine code
instruction(s) to translate each statement to. There's often more than one choice
and the best choice may depend on the context.

## Tree Matching
Instead of replacing individual nodes in the AST with specific instructions, we
instead define a bunch of patterns that match subtrees of the AST and generate a
sequence of related instructions.
