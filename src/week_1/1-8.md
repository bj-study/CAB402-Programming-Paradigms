# 1.8: Learn about the Church Turing Thesis

## Church-Turing Thesis
The Church-Turing proved that Turing Machines and Lambda Calculus were equivalent 
in computing power. Anything solvable by a turing machine, could also be solved by
lambda calculus and visa verse.

It was also hypothesised that Turing Machines and Lambda Calculus effectively define
a set of functions that can be computed. This means that if a turing machine cannot 
solve a problem, then no computer can.

## Computability
There is a need to distinguish between the terms Computational Complexity and Computability.

For any given problem, there are a variety of algorithms one could use to solve it.
If a problem has such a high computational complexity that it would take 1000 of years to solve,
we may say it's impossible, although it is still solvable with computers.

However, if the problem is not computable, it doesn't matter how long we try to solve
it, it just isn't solvable. If the problem is undecidable, then there exists no 
algorithm that can solve it.
