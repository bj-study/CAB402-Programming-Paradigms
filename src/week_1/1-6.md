## 1.6: Learn about Arithmetic in Lambda Calculus

Due to Lambda Calculus designed to be simple, it does not have built in support 
for numeric literals or numeric operations.

We can however, encode/represent numbers as functions:
- 0 = \\( \lambda f. \lambda x.x \\)
- 1 = \\( \lambda f. \lambda x.f(x) \\)
- 2 = \\( \lambda f. \lambda x.f(f(x)) \\)
- 3 = \\( \lambda f. \lambda x.f(f(f(x))) \\)

We can say the successor of a number is:

\\[\text{succ} = \lambda n. \lambda f. \lambda x. f(n f x) \\]

We could say that addition is:

\\[\text{plus} = \lambda n. \lambda m. (n \text{ succ } m) \\]

Multiplication would be:

\\[\text{mult} = \lambda n. \lambda m. n(\text{plus } m) 0 \\]

and we could go on...
