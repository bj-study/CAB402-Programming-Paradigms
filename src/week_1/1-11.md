# 1.11: Learn about the Von Neumann Architecture

The Von Neumann Architecture, is a general purpose design for a stored program computer which is still used to this day.
It proposed that:
- Data and instructions are both stored as binary digits in the primary storage
- Instructions are then fetched from memory serially
- The processor then decodes and executes the fetched instruction before cycling to the next
- This process continues until there are no more available instructions
