# 1.3: Learn about Lambda Calculus

## Lambda Calculus
Lambda Calculus is a model of computation created by Alonzo Church where, unlike 
Turing Machines, is based on pure mathematics.
Lambda Calculus expressions are defined recursively as follows:
- \<expression\> := \<name\> | \<function\> | \<application\>
- \<function\> := \\( \lambda \\) \<name\>.\<expression\>
- \<application\> := \<expression\>\<expression\>

For example, consider we have some function \\( f \\) which squares it's input: \\[ f(x) = x^2 \\]
In Lambda Calculus, we would re-write this function as: \\[ \lambda x.x^2 \\]which could then be written in code as:
```haskell
# Haskell

(\ x -> x^2)
```
or
```js
# Javascript

(x) => return x^2
```
