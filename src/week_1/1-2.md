## 1.2: Learn about Turing Machines

### Turing Machines
Turing Machines are abstract computational models created by Alan Turing. 
These machines would computate some state via reading and writing from an infinite tape.

A Turing Machine consists of a few things:
1. An infinite tape representing the machines memory. Each cell can contain a 
single symbol defined from a finite set.
2. A tape head that acts as a pointer to the current cell of memory
3. A state transition table describing and governing how the machine behaves

The machine is fed an input consisting of some string of bits where the machine 
will then consult the transition functions table and, based on it's current state and 
the symbol currently pointed at, will make its next choice and act on that.

| current state | input symbol | output/write symbol | direction to move | new state |
|---------------|--------------|---------------------|-------------------|-----------|
| State 1 | 0 |   | Right |         |
| State 1 | 1 | 0 | Right | State 2 |
| State 2 | 0 |   | Right | State 3 |
| State 2 | 1 |   | Right |         |
| State 3 | 0 | 1 | Left  | State 4 |
| State 3 | 1 |   | Right |         |
| State 4 | 0 |   | Left  | State 5 |
| State 4 | 1 |   | Left  |         |
| State 5 | 0 | 1 | Right | State 6 |
| State 5 | 1 |   | Left  |         |
| State 6 | 0 |   |       | Halt    |
| State 6 | 1 | 0 | Right | State 2 |

### Universal Turing Machine
A universal Turing Machine is a machine which can simulate any Turing Machine.
- The input tape contains the "program" & the input data.
- The transition table is finite. This allows any program to be encoded via a single integer number.
