# 1.7: Learn about Recursion in Lambda Calculus

Lambda Calculus handles the concept of looping via recursion. With recursion, 
we simple re-call the function until some pre-defined condition is met.

Recursion in Lambda Calculus however, is not as simple as naming a function and 
recursively recalling it due to another constraint presented to us being that 
we cannot have named functions.

To get around this, we can use something called the Fixed Point Combinator (\\( Y \\)).

\\[
    Y = \lambda f.(\lambda x. f(x x))(\lambda x. f(x x))
\\]

using \\(Y \\), we can define recursion.

\\[
    \text{Factorial} = Y(\lambda r. \lambda n. \text{if } n \text{ == } 0 \text{ then } 1 \text{ else } (\text{mult } n(r(n-1))))
\\]
