# Learn about ReactJS Mutable State

## Immutable Properties
Properties are provided when a React component is created, these are immutable and
cannot be changed. All React componenets must act like pure functions with respect
to their props.

## Mutable State
ReactJS has mutable state but can only be used via `useState()`, a function ReactJS
provides to us that provides a getter and setter method.

```jsx
const Clock = () => {
 // getter ðŸ‘‡
    const (time, setTime) = useState(new Date())
        // setter ðŸ‘†

    useEffect(() => {
        const timerId = setInterval(() => setTime(new Date()), 1000);

        return function cleanup() {
          clearInterval(timerId);
        };    
    }, []);

    return (
        <div>{time.toLocaleTimeString()}</div>
    )
}
```
