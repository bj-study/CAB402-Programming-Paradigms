# Learn about Reactive Programming

## Reactive Programming
The main idea behind reactive programming is side effects, i.e. If I change this
thing, something else should be automatically updated.

Functional reactive programming is a programming paradigm for reactive programming
using the building blocks defined by functional programming, i.e. map, reduce, filter, etc..

## Reactive Manifesto
Reactive programming can be broken down into four main properties:
1. Responsive: Systems respond in a timely manner
2. Resilient: Systems must stay responsive in the face of failure
3. Elastic: Systems should continue to work reliably even as the workload increases
4. Message Driven: Asynchronous message passing is used to ensure loose coupling
