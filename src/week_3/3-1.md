# 3.1: Learn about F# Lists and Match Expressions

## Collections
Collections are a way of storing multiple values within a single variable. There
are a variety of data types which can accomplish this.

## Lists
Lists are an immutable collection of non-unique values all of the same data
type.

```fsharp
// Instantiate a list with values
// Returns [7; 4; 1; 9]
let myList = [7; 4; 1; 9]

// Instantiate an empty list
// Returns []
let empty = []

// Retrieve the value at the second index in myList
// Returns 1
let x = myList.[2]

// Add 5 to the head of myList and store its returned data
// Returns [5; 7; 4; 1; 9]
let secondList = 5::myList

// Concatenate two lists together and store its returned data 
// Returns [7; 4; 1; 9; 4; 5; 2]
let thirdList = myList @ [4; 5; 2]
```

## Pattern Matching
Pattern matching is a way of matching a number of conditions against a certain
value.

In F#, pattern matching follows the syntax:
```
match [something] with
| pattern1 -> expression1
| pattern2 -> expression2
| pattern3 -> expression3
| _ -> catch all expression
...
```

For example,
```fsharp
let lucky x = match x with
    | 7 -> true
    | 12 -> true
    | _ -> false
```

## Recursion with Lists
F# doesn't have while loops or for loops, to iterate we instead
use recusion.

For example, say we want to get the length of a list. In an imperative language,
we might see something like this:

```rust
fn length<T>(array: &[T]) -> usize {
    let mut count = 0;

    for element in array {
        count += 1;
    }

    return count;
}

fn main() {
    let names = ["Josh", "Ben", "Jenna", "Brook"];
    let length = length(&names);

    println!("{length}");
}
```

In F# however, we combine the use of recursion and match statements to 
accomplish the same thing.

```fsharp
let rec length array =
    match array with
    | [] -> 0
    | head::tail -> 1 + (length tail)

let names = ["Josh"; "Ben"; "Jenna"; "Brook"]
let length = length names

printfn "%d" length
```

In the example above we define a recursive (`rec`) function `length` which takes
in a single parameter `array`.

We then match against the value contained in `array`. 
- `[]`: if `array` is an empty list, return 0
- `head::tail`: separate the head from the tail and recusively call `length` again
    with just the tail, adding 1 to its result

## List Ranges
F# gives us the ability to create a list based on a range of some values using
the range operator (`..`).

```fsharp
// Returns [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6; 7; 8; 9; 10]
let counters = [1 .. 10]
```
