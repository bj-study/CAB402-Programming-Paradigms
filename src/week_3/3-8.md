# Learn about Generic Types

## Genrics
Generics allow us to write code that works for a variety of types.

For example, say we have some function
```fsharp
let twice f x = f (f x)
```
the signature for `twice` could be inferred to as `f:('a -> 'a) -> x:'a -> 'a`.

This will allow it to be used as such:

```fsharp
// where 'a is `int` and ((+) 1) is `int -> int`
twice ((+) 1) 42

// where 'a is `int list`
twice List.map ((*) 2) [3, 2, 5]
```

However, the following code would not work:
```fsharp
// Won't work because f in this case is `string -> int`, not `'a -> 'a`
twice String.length "fred"
```

## Generic Types
It's possible to build your own generic types via the `<'t>` operator 
where `'t` is the generic name.

For example, `List<'t>` is a generic list where `'t` can refer to:
- An integer
- A string
- A list
- etc...

allowing a list of `<'t>` to be composed.

`List` type definition looks something similar to this:
```fsharp
type List<'t> =
    | Empty
    | NonEmpty(head:'t; tail:List<'t>)
```

## Option
Sometimes we need to represent a value that is optional, there's either someting or nothing. 
We can do so using the `Option` type.

```fsharp
// Definition for show
type Option<'t> =
    | Some 't
    | None

let rec tryFindMatch pred list =
    match list with
    | head::tail -> if pred(head) then Some(head) else tryFindMatch pred tail
    | [] -> None

let result = tryFindMatch (fun elem -> elem = 100) [200; 100; 50; 25]
```
