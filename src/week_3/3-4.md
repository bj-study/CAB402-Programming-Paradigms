# Learn about Function Piping
Long sequences of function chaining can become hard to read. Let's imagine we have
the following series of function calls: `f(g(h(x)))`

To understand what is even happening here, we need to read from inside-to-out.
- First the function `h` is applied to expression `x`
- Then function `g` is applied to the result of the previous function evaluation
- Then function `f` is applied to the result of the previous function evaluation

To avoid this, it's very common to see the pipeline operator (`|>`) used instead.

The pipeline operator is used to pass the value of the previous expression to the
first argument in the following expression.

For example, we could rewrite the function chain `f(g(h(x)))` as `x |> h |> g |> f`.
Now, we're reading it from left-to-right instead of right-to-left.

Here's another example but in the context of F#:

```fsharp
let foo list =
    list
    |> List.map (fun x -> x * x)
    |> List.reduce (+)
    |> printfn "%d"
```

In the example above, the value returned from the previous expression is passed
as the first argument in the next expression without us needing to write it.
