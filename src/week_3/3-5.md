# Learn about Static vs Dynamic Typing

## Dynamic and Static Languages
Dynamic languags are languages which at runtime may execute particular behaviours
such as adding new code, extending object definitions, or modifying the type system.

There are many dynamic languges, for example:
- Javascript
- PHP
- Python
- Perl
- MATLAB
- Ruby

Static languages on the other hand require all these checks are handled before the
application is even run (during compile). Before the lanaguage can be compiled,
it must pass a certain number of tests such as ensuring all variables are type.

There are many static languges, for example:
- Java
- C
- C++
- Objective-C
- C#

## Typing
There are a variety of typing systems:
- **Strongly typed vs Weakly typed**: Does the system check that types are always as expected?
- **Statically typed vs Dynamically typed**: Is type checking done at compile time or runtime?
- **Explicitly typed vs Implicitly typed**: Is the type of each variable declared explicit or inferred by the compiler?
