# How Closures are Implemented

## Capturing Variables that no longer exist
```csharp
Func<int, bool> Evaluate(List<int> list) {
    var avg = list.Average();

    return (x => x > avg);
}

void Foo() {
    var sample = new List<int> { 19, 20, 30 };
    var good = Evaluate(sample);
    var result = sample.Where(good);
}
```

The language must implement some way to save the values of variables that
get captured. There are two ways it can generally achieve this:
1. Store all captured variables on the Heap ather that the stack (C#'s solution)
2. Make a copy of the captured variables when the closure is created (Java's solution)

What would happen then if a variables value changes between the time it's captures
and the time it's invoked?
- In pure functional languages captured variables cannot change.
- In Java, this would be regarded as an error as all captured variables must
be final
