# Introduction to Closures

## Closures
A closure is an inline function that captures variables in the surounding
lexical scope. A closure allows the function to access captured variables
through the closures reference to them, even when the function is invoked
outside their scope.

In the example, the closure `aboveAverage` captures the variable `avg` where
it can be used elsewhere.

```csharp
static void Main() {
    var list = new List<int> { -1, 200, 3 };
    var avg = list.Average();

    Func<int, bool> aboveAverage = (x => x > avg);

    Foo(aboveAverage);
}

static object Foo(Func<int, bool> good) {
    var sample = new List<int> { 19, 20, 30 };
    
    return sample,Where(good);
}
```
