# Java 8 Java InvokeDynamic

## InvokeDynamic
`invokedynamic` is a bytecode instruction designed to help execute dynamic
languages more efficiently. With dynamic languages, methods can be added
to a class or object dynamically so the binding from method name to method
implementation needs to happen at runtime.

`invokedynamic` triggers some language specific boostrap code that does this
runtime method resolution and returns a method handle. Subsequent calls at this
call site invoke this same method to handle and avoid the more expensive runtime
method resolution.
