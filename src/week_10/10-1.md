# Functions as First-class Citizens

## First-class Citizens
A first-class citizen is an entity that supports operations typically available
to other entities. This typically includes operations such as being passed
as an argument, being returned from a function, and being able to be assigned
to a variable.

A function is said to be a first-class citizen if it's able to be stored, passed,
and returned just as any other type could.

A function literal does not need to have a name, think of this like an anonymous
function. Function literals can be created at one place, stored, then invoked
at a later time.

```fsharp
let sumOfSquaresUpTo list =
    list
    |> List.filter (fun x -> x % 3 = 0)
    |> List.sumBy (fun x -> x * x)

let positive: (int -> bool) = (fun x -> x > 0)
```

```c
bool positive(int x) {
    return x > 0;
}

int main() {
    bool (*test) (int) = positive;

    if (test(42)) {
        printf("true");
    }

    return 0;
}
```

```csharp
class Program {
    delegate bool Predicate(int x);

    static void Main() {
        var list = new List<int> {-1, 2, 3};
        var result = list.Find(x => x > 0);

        Predicate positive = (x => x > 0);
        Foo(positive);
    }

    static void Foo(Predicate test) {
        if (test(42)) {
            Console.WriteLine(true);
        }
    }
}
