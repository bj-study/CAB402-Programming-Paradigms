# Learn about Prolog Rules

## Rules
Rules define implicit relationships between objects. When one associated condition
is true, then the predicate is also true. For example:
- Lillian is happy if she dances
- John is hungry if he is searching for food
- Jack and Bill are friends if both of them love computers

Rules are defined via the `:-` ("if" or "is implied by") symbol.

```prolog
happy(lillian) :- dances(lillian)
hungry(john) :- search_for_food(john)
friends(jack, bill) :- loves_computers(jack), loves_computers(bill)
```
