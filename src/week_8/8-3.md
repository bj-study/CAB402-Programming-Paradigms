# Learn about Prolog Facts

## Prolog Facts
Facts can be defined as explicit relationships between objects and the properties
the objects have. Therefore, facts are unconditionally true in nature. For example,
- John is a person
- Ben likes pizza
- Josh is active

Facts are defined by `relation(object1, object2)`.

```prolog
person(john)
likes(ben, pizza)
active(josh)
```
