# 2.3: Learn about DotNet

## What is .NET?
.NET is a cross-platform build tool designed by Microsoft to build applications
that are supported on multiple platforms.

F# is one of the languages supported within the .NET family and therefore can be
used to build applications with it.

.NET first compiles the supported languages code into Microsoft Common Intermediate Language (CIL)
which is then run on a targeted machine via a JIT compiler.

## F# Introduction
So what does F# look like beyond a "Hello, World!" program? Below is a small program
which calculates the fibonacci sequence up to \\( n \\) numbers using recursion.

```fsharp
module Fibonacci

let rec fib n =
    match n with
    | 0 | 1 -> n
    | n -> fib (n-1) + fib (n-2)
```
