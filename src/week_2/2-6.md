# 2.6: Learn about F# Nested Bindings

## Nested Bindings
F# gives us the ability to bind local values within other bindings.
A local binding however, can only be used within the enclosing binding.

```fsharp
let area r =
    let pi = 3.14159
    let sqr x = x * x

    pi * (sqr r)

area 4.0
```

## Lexical Scoping
Much like Python, F# uses white-space and indentation to determine scroping rules.
Any program elements that are intended to be at the same scope/level, must be within
the same indentation.
