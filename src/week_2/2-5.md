# 2.5: Learn about F# Basics

## F# Types
F# is a strongly typed language, this means that all values have a fixed type at compile time.

Here is an example of a few types provided to us:

| Value  | Type    |
|--------|---------|
| 7      | int     |
| 7L     | int64   |
| 7I     | bigint  |
| 7I     | bigint  |
| true   | bool    |
| 3.14   | float   |
| 3.14F  | single  |
| 3.14M  | decimal |
| 'a'B   | byte    |
| 'a'    | char    |
| "text" | string  |

## Binding
In F# we are unable to assign variables, instead, we bind the value to some name.

```fsharp
let <name> = <expression>
```

Once a value is bound it is immutable, we are unable to change it further down 
the line. 

## Defining Functions
Functions are defined by prefixing some name with the `let` keyword and followed by
\\(n \\) arguments. The right hand side of the `=` sign denotes the logic
that will follow when called.

```fsharp
let add x y = x + y

add 2 4
```

F# has two types of function calls, infix and prefix. Let's take a look at the 
addition (+) function to see how they differ.

```fsharp
// Infix notation
2 + 4 

// Prefix notation
(+) 2 4
```

Looking at the example above we can determine that our custom function `add()` is used via 
prefix notation.
